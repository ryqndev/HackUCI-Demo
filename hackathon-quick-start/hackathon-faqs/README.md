# First hackathon, huh?

For most of you, this is probably your first hackathon and you're perhaps unsure of where to start. I'm here to help!

### Who are you?

This is meant for first-time high school/collegiate hackathon goers who are feeling a lil' unsure about things.


### Who am I?

I've participated, mentored, and judged for about 30+ collegiate hackathons on the west coast (of the US) and I've noticed most people have the same questions and I'd like to make this quick guide to get you up and running for your hackathon.

## Hackathon Timeline
In the current state of things, quarantine has made pretty much all hackathons virtual. This changes some things and I'll outline the main differences as well.

#### Registration
This happens before hackathons start but at non-virtual hackathons, there is usually a physical registration right before the hackathon begins to get a tally of who is there and to sign waivers.

#### Opening Ceremony
Opening ceremonies take place right before hacking begins and usually outlines ground rules (code of conduct) and introduces sponsors/prizes. This has a bunch of information about what the hackathon is about, but also resources that will be made available to you for the duration of the hackathon.

In virtual hackathons, this usually ends up being live streamed through youtube or twitch. At in-person hackathons, all hackers sit in some sort of auditorium and speakers/demos are done on stage.

The length of this ranges depending on how big the hackathon is. Bigger hackathons will have more sponsors and feature keynote speakers and will last longer (up to an hour or so).

#### Hacking Begins
When people are allowed to start working on their projects, there are a variety of other events going on:

##### Teambuilding
If you're going to your first hackathon and your friends decided not to go, it's often helpful to attend teambuilding ceremonies and try to meet new people! You don't *have* to do this and you're not expected to but I think it makes for a good experience.

Note, I was absolutely terrified at my first hackathon and didn't talk to anyone and did the event solo. For some, it can be scary and that's okay! After I went to more and more hackathons, I found that meeting new people was pretty fun and built up my confidence gradually.

##### Workshops
Workshops are like lectures but instead of being given by professors, it's usually by sponsors or hackathon organizers. Hackathons accept hackers of various different skill sets and skill levels so some workshops may not be appealing to you and others may just be out of your comprehension. It's good to know what a workshop is going to be about so you can be prepared or decide whether or not it's for you. You can ask mentors about what certain topics are about or the workshop leads directly to see if they're for you. Usually these are completely optional but give out swag for participants.

##### Food
Virtual hackathons - sorry there's no such thing as virtual food.

EDIT: HackDavis proved me wrong

In person hackathons will usually have food provided for you and your experience will differ, vastly. Some hackathons get catering from high-end local restaurants and other places will just order pizza. Usually it'll be a combination of both. Most of this comes down to how much funding they have but know that hackathon organizers try their best to give hackers a memorable experience.

#### Hacking Ends
Before hacking ends, you're going to want to submit your project for demo. This is almost always done through DevPost and you should almost always submit. Even if your hack isn't finished or is missing key functionality, I think you should atleast go through a demo so you can show off what you spent your time on. As a mentor, what's most important to me isn't just seeing the amazing demonstrations that people do but also finding out what people learned. Seeing people pick up entire languages and api's within a day or two is always the coolest part of hackathons to me and you can be sure that the mentors/sponsors/organizers/volunteers that helped you along the way share your happiness and pride in what you made!


#### Closing Ceremony
This is your time to relax and chill out for a bit. Closing ceremony is usually done in the same way the opening ceremony is done and is almost ALWAYS delayed. This is because judging takes time and most judges don't realize how many teams they have to look at and how important the 3-5 minute time limit is.
