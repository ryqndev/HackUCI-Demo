# Learning Web Dev

## Why do web dev?

For a hackathon, you'll find that most teams end up submitting a web-dev project. Why is that? It boils down to several main points:

1. Easy to setup and low barrier of entry compared to other forms of development

We'll go over the setup for web-dev below but the popular development platforms all have various restrictions. 

* iOS - every developer *needs* to have a Mac to write code (XCode) or test (Simulator on Mac or Apple device)
* Android - Android Studio is pretty much required IDE and need Android phone to do testing. Also, there are hundreds of Android phones out there - each vastly different (compared to iOS where there's only iPhone and iPad..ish)
* Unity/other game development - Game development is a completely different beast and not only requires assets but also may be challenging for people who aren't familiar with general game dev concepts (game loop, physics, etc.)
* Hardware - needs hardware and ... physical proximity with hardware. As of early 2021, still haven't seen a virtual hackathon team make it work without breaking official health mandates. Pre-covid19, main restriction was needing hardware (which is expensive).

## Setup

How do I get started on web dev? You only need 2 things: a text editor and a browser - both of which can by found on almost any computer without extra installation. VSCode is the recommended IDE and Chrome/Firefox is the recommended browser.

## Learning Web Dev

First, install the various extensions on VSCode that I have listed in the extensions.txt file. These aren't required to run your programs but highly recommended to make developing easier. Next, check out the [final-commented folder](https://github.com/ryqndev/Intro-To-Web-Dev/tree/master/final-commented) in the root directory of this folder to learn HTML/CSS/JS. After that, you can check out how to make api calls starting with [learning-http-requests](https://github.com/ryqndev/Intro-To-Web-Dev/tree/master/hackathon-quick-start/learning-http-requests).
