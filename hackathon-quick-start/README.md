# Hackathon Quick Start

## What is this?

For most hackers participating in hackathons, 12-48 hours may not be enough time to properly go through all the fundamentals of a programming language, setup a customized development environment AND then ideate and develop an app from scratch capable of a proof-of-concept demo. This folder primarily aims to help first-time hackers get a demo up and running quick.


## Where to start?

Below is the expanded file system for this folder in detail. If you're at a collegiate hackathon for your first or second time, you may want to take a look into the hackathon-faqs folder first and read the README.md there. Otherwise, feel free to go straight to learning-web-dev to get started.

If you feel pretty comfortable with HTML/CSS/JS or if you're not planning on doing a web-dev project and are looking for information on how to make http requests, you can go straight to learning-http-requests.

| File/Folder      | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| README.md        | That's this you're reading right now. Just a description to display on the Github repo |
| extensions.txt   | Here are all the extensions I'm using that are relevant to the demo. They are available on VSCode and you can search them up in the extensions search bar to install them. (this is the same as the extensions.txt file in the main directory)|
| learning-web-dev | A brief introduction that gives some background info on web dev - especially in the context of a hackathon.  |\
| learning-http-requests | Here, we will look at https requests - what they're for, how to make them, and how we can test them |
| learning-apis    | Apps are dependent on data. Data is the driving force behind our technological advancements. Here, I will show you how to get data from API's and incorporate them into your app. |
